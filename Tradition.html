      The presence of Pithora Baba is considered as a solution to all the problems.
    A Pithora is always located at the threshold, or the Osari, 
    outside the first front wall or inside on the walls of the first room as one enters a house. 
    The painting usually floods the entire wall with figures.</p>

<p>One of the oldest crafts practised by women in Kerala,
     screw pine craft is the art of making different types of mats and wall hangings using the leaves of the screw pine plant as practised by artisans in Kerala.
     This art has flourished among the people of Kollam for over 800 years already.
     The leaves for this mat are taken from the sword-shaped thorny screw-pine plant. 
    The process is tough as the leaf has sharp thorns growing in both directions.</p>
